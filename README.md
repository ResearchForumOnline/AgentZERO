## ⚡ What is OpenZero?

**OpenZero** is a sovereign AI agent designed to run completely on **bare metal**. Unlike cloud-based models that harvest your data and restrict your prompts, OpenZero lives directly on your hardware. It learns from your files, browses the web autonomously, and operates with **Terminal Sovereignty**.

It is governed by the proprietary **Probability of Goodness $P(G)$** equation—a mathematical logic gate ensuring the agent remains aligned with ethical harmony, even while possessing the raw power to execute system-level bash commands on your server.

> **Architect's Note:** I do this research and build these frameworks for free. If you want to skip the source-code compilation, grab the pre-compiled `openzero_release.zip` or the full ZeroMint OS image below! ^_^

## 💿 ZEROMINT OS (NEW RELEASE)

Why install dependencies when you can flash the entire architecture? **ZeroMint OS** is our custom, highly-optimized operating system built on Linux Mint 22.3 Cinnamon. The OpenZero Lattice, Ollama Neural Engine, PM2 Process Manager, and Remote Desktop (XRDP) are permanently baked into the silicon.

### How to Deploy ZeroMint OS:
1. **Download the ISO:** [ZeroMint_OS_v1.0.iso (3.2GB)](https://openzero.talktoai.org/ZeroMint_OS_v1.0.iso)
2. **Flash to USB:** Use [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) (Windows) or [BalenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) (Mac/Linux) to write the ISO to an 8GB+ USB drive.
3. **Boot & Install:** Plug it into any old PC or laptop and boot from USB.
4. **Default Credentials:** Once installed, log in with:
   * Username: `zero`
   * Password: `1234ZERO` *(Change this immediately via terminal using the `passwd` command)*
5. **Ignite:** Double-click the "Ignite OpenZero" icon on your desktop to activate the Sovereign Lattice.

## 🌌 Core Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🧠 Recursive Intelligence** | Powered by **Gemma 2 (9B)** (Local) or **Groq LPUs** (Cloud). Evolves with every interaction. |
| **🛡️ The $P(G)$ Equation** | A logic gate that calculates the *Probability of Goodness* before executing any high-risk action. |
| **👁️ Moltbot Vision** | A headless Chromium browser that navigates, takes screenshots, and extracts OSINT data autonomously. |
| **💾 ChromaDB Memory** | Long-term vector storage (RAG) allows OpenZero to ingest documents, recall history, and cite sources. |
| **📱 Telegram Uplink** | Connect your node to BotFather for secure, remote control via your smartphone. |
| **☣️ Terminal Sovereignty** | **[WARNING]** OpenZero can execute `bash` commands, manage files, and control servers via SSH. It is a SysAdmin, not a chatbot. |

## 🚀 Bare Metal Deployment (For Existing Servers)

If you already have a Linux server (Ubuntu/Debian/AlmaLinux/Mint) with at least **16GB RAM** and **30GB Disk Space**, you can deploy the OpenZero software directly.

### The 1-Click Installer
Deploy the entire lattice, including the Node.js Vision systems and Python Brain, with a single command:

```bash
curl -sL [https://openzero.talktoai.org/install.sh](https://openzero.talktoai.org/install.sh) | bash
