## ⚡ What is OpenZero?

**OpenZero** is a sovereign AI agent designed to run on **bare metal**. Unlike cloud-based models that are rented and restrained, OpenZero lives on your hardware, learns from your data, and operates with **Terminal Sovereignty**.

It is built on the **Probability of Goodness [P(G)]** equation—a mathematical framework that ensures the agent remains aligned with ethical harmony even while possessing the power to execute system-level commands.

Please go to file: openzero_release.zip  for the proper code etc, i do not get paid for this work i do so i am lazy with some things! ^_^

## 🌌 Core Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🧠 Recursive Intelligence** | Powered by **Gemma 2 (9B)** and **Spectra8**, it evolves with every interaction, reshaping its own knowledge base. |
| **🛡️ The P(G) Equation** | A proprietary logic gate that calculates the *Probability of Goodness* before executing any high-risk action. |
| **👁️ Moltbot Vision** | A headless Chromium hand that navigates, screenshots, and "sees" the web autonomously. |
| **💾 ChromaDB Memory** | Long-term vector storage (RAG) allows OpenZero to ingest documents, recall history, and cite sources. |
| **☣️ Terminal Sovereignty** | **[WARNING]** OpenZero can execute `bash` commands, manage files, and control servers via SSH. It is a SysAdmin, not a chatbot. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites
* **OS:** Linux (AlmaLinux / Ubuntu / Debian)
* **RAM:** 16GB+ (Recommended for 9B models)
* **Python:** 3.10+
* **Node.js:** 16+ (For Moltbot vision)

### ⚡ Quick Deployment (The "One-Liner")

If you trust the lattice, run the deployment script directly on your server:

```bash
curl -sL [https://openzero.talktoai.org/install.sh](https://openzero.talktoai.org/install.sh) | bash
